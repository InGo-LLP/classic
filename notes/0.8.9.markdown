### Forwards-compatibility with Dispatch 0.9+ (reboot)

This release changes the base package of the 0.8 line from `dispatch`
to `dispatch.classic`, so that Dispatch 0.8.9 and Dispatch 0.9.x may
be used on the same classpath.

This will require code changes in any project using Dispatch 0.8.
Typically, it will require changes to imports and any fully qualified
classname; e.g. `dispatch.Http` becomes `dispatch.classic.Http`.
